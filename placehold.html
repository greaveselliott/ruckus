<p>XXXX lets imagine for a minute<br>
Imagine a store where sales staff never leave a customer to check if something is in stock,<br>
Or where they can order out-of-stock items for next day home delivery while standing at the display.<br>
Or a store where customers don’t have to queue at a till to pay.<br>
All of this and more is possible now with Ruckus - From a single large store to hundreds of smaller boutiques across an entire country, Wi-Fi is the easiest way to connect customers and staff to the information they need to enable a sale.<br>
Ruckus Wireless is a market leader in Wi-Fi for mid-market retailers. Our solutions are simple to deploy, sold and supported by a huge choice of specialist resellers, and uses the smartest technology to ensure the best connection across the whole sales floor and back office.<br>
With Wi-Fi in store, staff can better service your customer’s better, and you can start thinking about how you can</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use location based services solutions - such as Ruckus SPoT™ - to review your footfall and see how people move around your store:
        <ul>
            <li>Change your window display and analyse how many more people come into the store than just walk past</li>
            <li>Match your highest margin products to the areas where your customers go most.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reward loyal customers with target promotions – something that nearly ¾ of all customers say they are happy to receive</li>
    <li>Understand more about your demographics and how your store is used at different times and on different days of the week.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“Almost every new consumer product today has an embedded Wi-Fi capability. To effectively demonstrate and sell these products, customers want to actually see and understand how to use them in a live environment. The Ruckus system, with its integrated adaptive antenna array technology, is simply in a different league and has helped increase in-store sales” <cite>Tim Pearce – Hughes Electrical (UK)</cite></blockquote>
